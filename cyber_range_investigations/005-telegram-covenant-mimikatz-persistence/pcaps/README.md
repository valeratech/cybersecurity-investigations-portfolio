# PCAP Artifacts

No packet capture (PCAP) files were provided for this investigation.

This case is based on Windows disk forensic artifacts from a triage image
within the CyberDefenders lab environment.

The investigation focused on:
- Registry analysis
- NTFS metadata
- Event logs
- LNK and ShellBag artifacts
- Persistence validation

If network captures were available, they would be stored in this directory.
