# Cybersecurity Investigations Portfolio

This repository is a central collection of my cybersecurity investigations completed across various CyberRanges and lab environments. It serves as a structured record of hands-on **DFIR, threat hunting, memory, disk, and network forensics** work across multiple training platforms.

Current investigations include (but are not limited to):

- **SANS/Netwars**: Specialized technical mastery and advanced incident handling.
- **Hack The Box**: Dedicated SOC and DFIR investigative labs.
- **CyberDefenders**: Artifact-driven challenges centered on real-world memory, endpoint, and network forensics.
- **Security Blue Team (BTLO)**: Operationally-focused labs simulating real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) environments.
- Additional **self-built investigations** and forensic exercises  

All investigations follow a consistent methodology, typically including:

- Case objectives and scenario background  
- Evidence collection and structured forensic analysis  
- Detection logic (KQL, Sigma, Zeek, Suricata, etc.)  
- Timeline reconstruction, IOCs, and attacker TTP mapping  
- Final findings and remediation recommendations  

> **Note:** All data in this repository is generated in lab environments or fully sanitized.  
> No real-world client or sensitive information is included.

Each investigation folder may contain its own detailed report, along with any relevant artifacts, queries, scripts, diagrams, and supporting materials if applicable.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Demonstrate practical, hands-on **DFIR and Blue Team capabilities**  
- Maintain version-controlled documentation for all investigation work  
- Track progress across multiple CyberRanges and training platforms  
- Serve as a **professional cybersecurity portfolio** for job applications and long-term career development
